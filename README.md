.Write a IntOpt.java program by taking a, b and c as input values and print the
following integer operations a + b *c, a * b + c, c + a / b, and a % b + c. Please
also understand the precedence of the operators.

. Similarly write the DoubleOpt.java program by taking double value and doing the
same operations.


. Write a program Distance.java that takes two integer command-line arguments x
and y and prints the Euclidean distance from the point (x, y) to the origin (0, 0). The
formulae to calculate distance = sqrt(x*x + y*y). Use Math.power function.


. Write a program SumOfTwoDice.java that prints the sum of two random integers
between 1 and 6 (such as you might get when rolling dice).
